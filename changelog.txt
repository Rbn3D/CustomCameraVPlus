1.4

* Added an option to set the angle of the thrid person camera! (Configurable in settings)

1.3

* Reworked dynamic camera distance based on acceleration and speed (third person camera). Fixes some bugs and provides better visual feedback.
* Fixed 3rd person camera getting too close to the vehicle at high speeds.
* New option "InertiaAffectsPitch" on 3rd person camera, wich makes the camera look down when the car loses acceleration quickly or brakes (Diabled by default)
* New option "InertiaEffects" on 1st person camera, wich makes the camera move forward / back based on vehicle acceleration (Enabled by default)
* Adjusted 1st person camera distance to be a little more distant

1.2 

*  New 3rd person camera system, more like the built-in GTAV camera, so when you are at low speed camera angle it's unlocked, with no autocenter, but as you get some speed it chases you more actively, so you can clearly see where the car is going (Unlike vanilla cam).
*  New 3rd person is also better for drifting, because it lets you see the rotation of the car when it slides (the cam behaviour it's not related to vehicle rotation anymore, but it's velocity, speed, previous cam position and acceleration)

1.1

*  Implemented dynamic pivot position and rotation speed. More believable cam behavior.
*  Set default gamepad deadzone to 0 and implement gamepad easing instead (Makes more sense as R* already applies deadzone) (both deadzone and easing are configurable via INI file).
*  Added a sensibility setting for both gamepad/mouse (via INI file).
*  Fixed an error where camera wasn't taking towed vehicle/trailer distance into account (this happened only in v1.0).

1.0:

* Reworked 3rd person camera algorithm (completely rewritten)
* 3rd person camera rotation doesn't get affected by suspension bounciness
* Look around/aim/shoot has been reimplemented and now supports gamepad as well as keyboard
* Progressive deadzone implemented when looking with gamepad, for better aim precision
* Look left/right quickly by pressing hotkeys (configurable via ini file)
* Support to look left/right/back from steering wheel!
